# DiseaseGraph

[Link](http://www.diseasegraph.com)

DiseaseGraph is a visual representation of the relationships shared by diseases and the strengths of these relationships. Nodes represent diseases and link widths represent the strengths of association between them.

Each graph has a central node from which all other nodes and links are created. The node sizes and the link widths are all normalized to each graph, so that the actual numerical values may differ from one graph to another.

Within the database are 4,672 diseases or disorders. These are categorized into 27 broad categories, and a disease may fall into one or more of these categories.

Over 11 million PubMed abstracts were analyzed. The size of the nodes represent how often a disease is mentioned in the medical literature.

The method used here captures high-level abstract relationships, with no delineation of the type of relationship. The association link between two diseases may be based on similar presentations, similar pathologic process, similar affected anatomic locations, or any number of relationship types. Two linked diseases may be even causal, but there is no inference of causality or temporality in the graph itself.
