DiseaseLink

The DiseaseLink graph explorer is a visual representation of the relationships shared by diseases and the strengths of these 
relationships. Nodes represent diseases and link widths represent the strengths of association between them. These graphs are based on 
co-occurrence data in the biomedical literature, from analysis of over 11 million PubMed abstracts.
